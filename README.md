Module 12 Assignment - Employee Tracker - Node + MYSQL

# Employee Tracker - MYSQL

## Description

In this assigment we built a database using MYSQL, setting up both a schema.sql for the database, and a seeds.sql with test data. I learned a lot about the syntax asscociated with creating and running a database in MSQL (CAPITAL LETTERS!) and using test data to update information in our database. I was also introduced to a dependency called 'figlet' which allowed our database to be read in node with a fun block-type text. Overall this was a good experience to work with MYSQL, writing the proper code to connect, and having a dotenv file to store our user/password information
